################ TO DO ################

• Increase timeout of SPI transmission. It is counted in ms. # Don't care


• Problem with transmission odserved during 8 <-> 16 bit switching.
	Create separate branches:
		- Workaround
		- Solution
	
	Workaround:
	- There is need to add function that can switch 2 byte  into 2 x 1 byte and then transmit as 8 bit
	- Set transmission always as 8 bit mode
	
	Solution:
	- Find out how transmission shoud look like. Check if there is need to have some dummy cycle etc.
	- Go into HAL driver and try to use most basic operations to transmit data in two modes
