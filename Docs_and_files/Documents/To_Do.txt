################ TO DO ################

• Increase timeout of SPI transmission. It is counted in ms.
# Done. Doesn't matter.


• Problem with transmission odserved during 8 <-> 16 bit switching.
	Create separate branches:
		- Workaround
		- Solution

	Workaround:
	- There is need to add function that can switch 2 byte  into 2 x 1 byte and then transmit as 8 bit
	- Set transmission always as 8 bit mode
	Solution:
	- Find out how transmission shoud look like. Check if there is need to have some dummy cycle etc.
	- Go into HAL driver and try to use most basic operations to transmit data in two modes
# Done. Cannot switch between byte and two byte transinnion mode without restarting SPI hw.

• UART transission.
	- Transission is done using usb cable. Port is localized there
	- Sending new line mark should effect with response some defined message (e.g. "Creature")
	- Using command I can change item list and its values
	- There is mechanism that let in easy way to add new command that run new function
	- Easy accessed and visibility connection between command <-> runned function
	- There have to be set of commands that do speciffic things
		○ Recieving command generates interrupt that saves recieved command and push order to stack
		○ Switch structure in Main loop runs function that can interpret command and add pointer to stack
